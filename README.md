# Multiple Choice Test Platform
The motivation behind building this app was to help my dad pass his Medical Theory test (which he did) by allowing him to take mock test without having to pay for costly services out there. The app fetches questions from different sources and bundles then into a large databse of multi-choice questions. The user of the app can take a test and see result upon submission. The user can see the history off all the test he has taken within the app. In order to take a test you need to signin or create a new account. It's built using VueJs and firebase and cloudfunctions for the backend.
